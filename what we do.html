                The food and agriculture industry are among the most diverse business sectors in the economy and one of the most heavily regulated, both domestically and internationally. Products ranging from essential farm products to genetically engineered whole foods or nutritional food supplements face specific and intricate regulatory schemes to ensure public safety. Thus, all require specific strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives to increase domestic market share and expand abroad.
                We help our international clients identify new markets and increase public awareness and branding.

          In less than a decade, the biotechnology field has matured from a frontier science into a well-established industry. The industry has witnessed significant advances in human health, agricultural production and biodefense. Still, it presents thrilling opportunities for the inventor as new technologies are developed, tested, and eventually produced for broad application.
          However, the excitement inherent to this industry is tempered by its intrinsic risks: the high costs of research and development; the long lead time required to develop new products; and potential legal problems for biotechnology firms, including regulatory issues, intellectual property protection and the potential for litigation.
          We assist our biotechnology clients on matters, including all manner of intellectual property protection licensing, technology transfer and franchising, and public policy in different countries.

                The future will belong to those who look to harness the power of technological innovation and the market system—while maintaining economic growth and encouraging global participation—to produce sound, clean and abundant forms of energy. The energy industry has seen massive growth in recent years. Oil and gas, nuclear energy, utilities and power generation, coal and renewable energy sources such as solar, hydropower, geothermal, biomass (ethanol), and wind generation are rapidly advancing to meet growing energy demands. To remain successful in this climate, companies must develop international development strategies including cross border mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and identifying industrial opportunities abroad. We will support our clients to evaluate business opportunities outside the firm's country of origin.

          The current economic environment has created many challenges 
          for the financial services industry. What began as a subprime mortgage 
          crisis has evolved into a mortgage "meltdown", potentially affecting 
          the performance of many types of mortgages, as well as residential, 
          construction, and commercial real estate loans. The resulting decline in 
          credit quality has adversely impacted many financial institutions' 
          liquidity and capital levels. The financial services industry faces 
          new and sometimes never seen obstacles and challenges. We provide strategic 
          counsel to commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, 
          broker-dealers, and other capital markets participants, including 
          investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds in 
          developing cross border synergies and identifying business opportunities 
          across the globe. We remain an invaluable ally for our partners 
          in the financial services industry, whether the markets are healthy 
          or in turmoil and utterly different business environments.

          Government relations refers to the sector of an organization 
          that focuses on public policy and advocacy. An effective 
          government relations approach requires an understanding of both 
          the politics and the operational bureaucratic drivers of change.
          Both levels of relationship are critical to provide strong 
          representation to the business community and balance the need for 
          short-term change with long-term policy re-engineering. 
          We understand government, legislative and regulatory processes and we have 
          extensive experience in assisting clients in the resolution of issues 
          arising from the complex relationships which evolve when business and 
          government interact. We provide clients with a broad and diverse 
          range of government relations and leverage our premier network of influential

                The transportation and infrastructure industry faces considerable challenges 
                in today's economy. Revenue margins are shrinking, 
                brought on by the high cost of energy, labour and a 
                host of other economic factors. Whether commuters, 
                tourists or cargo shippers, industry consumers are 
                demanding cheaper, faster transportation modes, 
                either by land, air or sea.
                Regulatory constraints on the various sectors of the 
                industry affect coalitions, state and local governments, 
                and domestic and international corporations with

        A succession of trends changes the luxury and fashion landscape

        At 8 Holding, we believe growth is no longer in the old back yard.
        Emerging markets will be a critical part of a consumer product company's 
        long-term global strategy, especially in the fashion and luxury 
        industries. We are ready to support our clients in 
        entering local market infrastructures and integrating emerging 
        market product strategies with their global strategy.
        Also, consolidation is forcing companies to be more sophisticated 
        in their collaboration with retailers. 
        The retail merger creates opportunities for developing strategic partnerships 
        and localization strategies that 
        transform results.
        Companies must learn what it takes to build winning 
        brands in this changing environment. The path to winning 
        brands starts with understanding 
        the markets and their opportunities.
        At 8 Holding, we help our clients improve their performance 
        by reducing costs, making their supply chain, marketing 
        and trade more effectively, and creating new 
        synergies through pertinent M&A activities.

          Manufacturing is a principal economic driver of many economies, 
          not only for the production of domestically consumed goods but as 
          a basis for international trade and investment.
          Today, manufacturers face unique challenges. 
          Intense competition in the manufacturing sector has driven 
          down prices and marginal profits, while the costs of labour, 
          raw materials, energy, and new technologies continue 
          to climb. The pressure to cut costs forces manufacturers 
          to look at alternative production methods, such 
          as automating and outsourcing and adopting 
          very often aggressive relocation plants. 8 Holding 
          on behalf of its clients look for efficient first-class 
          solutions to help manufacturing companies successfully 
          deal with this challenging global business environment.

              <p1 style="text-align: left;">
              
                The mining industry worldwide plays a critical role in 
                supplying the international demand for fuels, 
                metals, precious metals, aggregates and 
                agricultural and industrial minerals. 
                The industry faces many challenges in acquisitions 
                of resources and protecting the environment. 
                In the high-pressure, capital intensive climate of the mining industry, 
                8 Holding helps companies take a proactive approach to 
                meet their goals and overcome obstacles whether 
                the challenges are fast-paced asset acquisitions, 
                financial or royalty matters.
                There has been substantial, but cyclical, growth in the demand 
                for almost all mining products, as the world's 
                economy and standard of living advances. Dramatic 
                advances in technology and engineering have 
                significantly reduced many of the long-term 
                risks associated with mining and alleviated 
                several environmental and resource-limiting 
                consequences that were prevalent decades ago. 
                With new management perspectives, the modern 
                mining industry has produced massive 
                productivity, and production increases keep 
                up with demand and competition. And 
                they are continuously looking for opportunities at an 
                international level.

          Today, oil and gas companies face unprecedented geopolitical 
          challenges and daunting supply and demand issues, 
          increased security threats, and enormous economic pressures. 
          To add to these burdens, oil and gas industry players must 
          comply with the international level's complex
